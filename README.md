## c-tools

Some simple functions/macros I find helpful when writing C software.

- xmalloc: A wrapper for C's malloc which has a more useful return value.
- array: Some type generic macros for creating, freeing, and printing vectors and matrices.
- fetch_line: A program for easily reading and trimming text files
- random: A wrapper for random number generation and a bitmap based application.

Will add to this repo as/when needed.
